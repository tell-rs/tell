Tell Software License

Acceptance

This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions on which Licensor makes
the Software available to You. By accessing or using the Software or a
Modified Version in any manner, You agree to be bound by all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. If You are an individual accessing or using the
Software on behalf of a legal entity, (i) You represent and warrant that You
have the authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of such entity and
bind such entity to this Agreement, and (ii) references to "You" in this
Agreement will refer to such entity.

License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor grants You a
non-exclusive, worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to (i)
use, copy, distribute, and create Modified Versions of the Software, and (ii)
make, have made, use, and import the Software, where such license applies
only to those patent claims licensable by Licensor that are necessarily
infringed by the Software, in each case for the purpose of operating the
Software for Your own internal business purposes or personal use. If You make
any written claim of patent infringement relating to the Software, Your
patent license for the Software granted under this Agreement terminates
immediately.

License Key Requirements

If You are an Individual, You may use the Software without a License Key.

If You are a Company, You must obtain a License Key from Licensor before
using the Software in any environment. To obtain a License Key, You must
register with Licensor and provide accurate information including Your
company name, contact information, and Annual Revenue. You represent and
warrant that all information You provide to Licensor is complete and accurate
at the time of submission and that You will update such information if it
changes materially.

You must keep any License Key confidential and will not share it with third
parties other than Your affiliates, contractors, and agents who are obligated
to keep it confidential and use it solely on Your behalf. You will ensure
that such parties comply with the terms of this Agreement, and You will be
responsible for their acts and omissions.

You acknowledge that the Software may be subject to export control laws and
regulations. You agree to comply with all applicable export laws.

Payment Obligations

Your payment obligations are determined by Your Annual Revenue as follows:

(a) Annual Revenue less than One Million US Dollars ($1,000,000): No payment
required. You may use the full Software at no cost.

(b) Annual Revenue of One Million US Dollars ($1,000,000) or more but less
than Ten Million US Dollars ($10,000,000): You must maintain a current Pro
Subscription with Licensor. The current fee for a Pro Subscription is Two
Hundred Ninety-Nine US Dollars ($299) per month. Licensor may adjust this fee
upon 90 days written notice.

(c) Annual Revenue of Ten Million US Dollars ($10,000,000) or more: You must
maintain a current Enterprise Subscription with Licensor. Enterprise
Subscription fees are determined by agreement between You and Licensor,
starting at Two Thousand US Dollars ($2,000) per month.

Payment obligations apply regardless of how many instances of the Software
You operate or how many users access it. There are no per-seat, per-event, or
usage-based fees.

Revenue Reporting

You must accurately report Your Annual Revenue when registering for a License
Key. If Your Annual Revenue later increases to a level that requires a
Subscription or a higher-tier Subscription, You must obtain the appropriate
Subscription within 30 days of crossing the threshold.

Licensor may, upon reasonable notice, request verification of Your Annual
Revenue if Licensor has a good-faith belief that Your reported revenue is
inaccurate. You agree to cooperate with such verification requests.

Telemetry

The Software may collect and transmit Telemetry to Licensor. Telemetry helps
Licensor improve the Software and understand how it is used. For Individuals,
Telemetry is optional and may be disabled. For Companies, Telemetry is
required unless Licensor has provided You with a License Key that permits
Telemetry to be disabled.

You understand and agree that Licensor may use information collected as part
of Telemetry in accordance with Licensor's Privacy Policy. Telemetry does not
include Your proprietary data processed by the Software.

Restrictions

You will not, and will not permit others to:

(a) Offer the Software or a Modified Version to third parties as a managed
service, hosted service, or software-as-a-service, where the service provides
users with access to any substantial set of the features or functionality of
the Software;

(b) Alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, trademark, or other
notices of Licensor in the Software or a Modified Version;

(c) Use Licensor's trademarks, trade names, or logos without prior written
consent, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
the origin of the Software;

(d) Circumvent, disable, or interfere with any mechanism in the Software
related to License Key validation or Telemetry, except where Your License Key
explicitly permits disabling Telemetry.

If You create a Modified Version, You must include prominent notices stating
that You have modified the Software and must include a copy of this Agreement
with any distribution of the Modified Version.

No Other Rights

Except for the licenses expressly granted in this Agreement, Licensor grants
You no other licenses or rights in the Software, whether by implication,
estoppel, or otherwise.

Third-Party Software

The Software may contain or be provided with Third-Party Software. Each item
of Third-Party Software is subject to its own license terms, which can be
found in the documentation or source code. You agree to comply with all such
Third-Party Software license terms.

Termination

Your licenses under this Agreement will automatically terminate if You breach
any term of this Agreement. If Your breach is capable of being cured and You
cure it within 30 days to Licensor's reasonable satisfaction, Your licenses
will be reinstated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, intentional or repeated
breaches, including intentional misrepresentation of Annual Revenue, will
cause Your licenses to terminate immediately and permanently.

Upon termination, You must cease all use of the Software and destroy all
copies in Your possession or control.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR WILL NOT BE
LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF
LIABILITY AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

LICENSOR'S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER
OF (I) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO LICENSOR IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE
CLAIM, OR (II) ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS ($100).
