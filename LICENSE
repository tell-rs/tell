Tell Software License

Acceptance

This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions on which Licensor makes
the Software available to You. By accessing or using the Software or a
Modified Version in any manner, You agree to be bound by all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. If You are an individual accessing or using the
Software on behalf of a legal entity, (i) You represent and warrant that You
have the authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of such entity and
bind such entity to this Agreement, and (ii) references to "You" in this
Agreement will refer to such entity.

License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor grants You a
non-exclusive, worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to (i)
use, copy, distribute, and create Modified Versions of the Software, and (ii)
make, have made, use, and import the Software, where such license applies
only to those patent claims licensable by Licensor that are necessarily
infringed by the Software, in each case for the purpose of operating the
Software for Your own internal business purposes or personal use. If You make
any written claim of patent infringement relating to the Software, Your
patent license for the Software granted under this Agreement terminates
immediately.

License Key

If Your Annual Revenue is less than One Million US Dollars ($1,000,000), You
may use the Software without a License Key.

If Your Annual Revenue is One Million US Dollars ($1,000,000) or more, You
must obtain a License Key from Licensor and maintain the appropriate
Subscription before using the Software. To obtain a License Key, register
with Licensor at tell.rs.

You must keep any License Key confidential and will not share it with third
parties other than Your affiliates, contractors, and agents who are obligated
to keep it confidential and use it solely on Your behalf.

Payment Obligations

Your payment obligations are determined by Your Annual Revenue as follows:

(a) Annual Revenue less than One Million US Dollars ($1,000,000): No payment
required. You may use the full Software at no cost.

(b) Annual Revenue of One Million US Dollars ($1,000,000) or more but less
than Ten Million US Dollars ($10,000,000): You must maintain a current Pro
Subscription with Licensor. The current fee for a Pro Subscription is Two
Hundred Ninety-Nine US Dollars ($299) per month. Licensor may adjust this fee
upon 90 days written notice.

(c) Annual Revenue of Ten Million US Dollars ($10,000,000) or more: You must
maintain a current Enterprise Subscription with Licensor. Enterprise
Subscription fees are determined by agreement between You and Licensor,
starting at Two Thousand US Dollars ($2,000) per month.

(d) Managed Services: If You deploy, install, or operate the Software on
behalf of third-party clients (as an MSSP, MSP, or similar service provider),
whether hosted in Your infrastructure, the client's infrastructure, or any
third-party environment, You must maintain a current Managed Services
Subscription with Licensor. You must pay a separate fee for each Managed
Client, determined by the Managed Client's Annual Revenue using the same
tiers above, with a minimum fee of Ninety-Nine US Dollars ($99) per month per
Managed Client. For Managed Clients with Annual Revenue of Ten Million US
Dollars ($10,000,000) or more, Enterprise Subscription terms apply to that
Managed Client. Managed Services fees are in addition to any Subscription
required for Your own use of the Software. If the Annual Revenue of a Managed
Client is unknown, You must either obtain that information from the client or
contact Licensor to establish an estimated fee.

(e) Government, Education, and Non-Profit Organizations: If You are a
government entity, educational institution, or non-profit organization,
contact Licensor to determine appropriate Subscription terms, as revenue-
based pricing may not apply.

Payment obligations apply regardless of how many instances of the Software
You operate or how many users access it. There are no per-seat, per-event, or
usage-based fees.

Licensor reserves the right to modify Subscription fees and terms upon 90
days written notice. Continued use of the Software after such notice
constitutes acceptance of the modified terms. Current pricing is made available
by Licensor at tell.rs.

Revenue Reporting

You must accurately report Your Annual Revenue when registering for a License
Key. If Your Annual Revenue later increases to a level that requires a
Subscription or a higher-tier Subscription, You must obtain the appropriate
Subscription within 30 days of crossing the threshold.

Licensor may, upon reasonable notice, request verification of Your Annual
Revenue if Licensor has a good-faith belief that Your reported revenue is
inaccurate. You agree to cooperate with such verification requests.

Restrictions

You will not, and will not permit others to:

(a) Offer the Software or a Modified Version to third parties as a managed
service, hosted service, or software-as-a-service, where the service provides
users with access to any substantial set of the features or functionality of
the Software, unless You have a current Managed Services Subscription with
Licensor that covers such use;

(b) Alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, trademark, or other
notices of Licensor in the Software or a Modified Version;

(c) Use Licensor's trademarks, trade names, or logos without prior written
consent, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
the origin of the Software;

(d) Circumvent, disable, or interfere with any mechanism in the Software
related to License Key validation.

If You create a Modified Version, You must include prominent notices stating
that You have modified the Software and must include a copy of this Agreement
with any distribution of the Modified Version.

No Other Rights

Except for the licenses expressly granted in this Agreement, Licensor grants
You no other licenses or rights in the Software, whether by implication,
estoppel, or otherwise.

Third-Party Software

The Software may contain or be provided with Third-Party Software. Each item
of Third-Party Software is subject to its own license terms, which can be
found in the documentation or source code. You agree to comply with all such
Third-Party Software license terms.

Termination

Your licenses under this Agreement will automatically terminate if You breach
any term of this Agreement. If Your breach is capable of being cured and You
cure it within 30 days to Licensor's reasonable satisfaction, Your licenses
will be reinstated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, intentional or repeated
breaches, including intentional misrepresentation of Annual Revenue, will
cause Your licenses to terminate immediately and permanently.

Upon termination, You must cease all use of the Software and destroy all
copies in Your possession or control.

DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF
LIABILITY AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
